# ProjectKB Deployment Strategy - Minimal Viable Approach

## Current Status: 10 Consecutive Failures
- All releases v1.0.3 through v1.0.12 have failed
- Core issues: Missing dependencies, complex workflows, infrastructure complexity

## New Strategy: Minimal Viable Deployment (MVD)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Only (No Application Code)
1. **Deploy only AWS infrastructure** using Terraform
2. **Skip all application code** (frontend/backend)
3. **Use simple workflow** with minimal steps
4. **Verify infrastructure** is created successfully

### Phase 2: Backend Only
1. **Deploy only Lambda functions** (no frontend)
2. **Test API endpoints** directly
3. **Verify backend functionality**

### Phase 3: Frontend Only
1. **Deploy only React app** (no backend integration)
2. **Test frontend builds** and static hosting
3. **Verify frontend functionality**

### Phase 4: Full Integration
1. **Connect frontend to backend**
2. **End-to-end testing**
3. **Full application deployment**

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Create Ultra-Simple Infrastructure-Only Workflow
- Remove all frontend/backend steps
- Focus only on Terraform infrastructure deployment
- Use minimal Terraform configuration
- Test infrastructure creation in isolation

### Step 2: Validate Infrastructure Manually
- Check AWS console for created resources
- Verify S3 buckets, Cognito, DynamoDB exist
- Test basic AWS service connectivity

### Step 3: Gradual Application Integration
- Add backend deployment only after infrastructure works
- Add frontend deployment only after backend works
- Test each component individually

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Isolated Testing**: Each component tested separately
2. **Faster Debugging**: Easier to identify specific failures
3. **Incremental Success**: Build confidence with each working component
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler workflows = fewer failure points
