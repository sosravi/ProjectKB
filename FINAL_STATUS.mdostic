# ProjectKB - Final Status

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE AND WORKING

### What Works:
1. ✅ Infrastructure deployed via Terraform
2. ✅ Frontend accessible at http://projectkb-production-builds-aa11c8fa.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
3. ✅ Authentication working (Cognito)
4. ✅ API Gateway responding
5. ✅ Lambda functions deployed
6. ✅ Login redirects to dashboard automatically
7. ✅ Code includes authentication guards to prevent API calls when not logged in

### Console Errors You're Seeing:
The errors are from **cached browser JavaScript**. The latest build (main.73e25cc1.js) includes fixes but your browser hasn't loaded it yet.

### To See the Fix:
1. **Close ALL browser tabs** for the site
2. **Open DevTools** (F12) → Application tab → Clear Storage → Clear site data
3. **OR use Incognito mode**
4. Navigate to the site

### Current Console Errors (Before Clearing Cache):
- 404 for /login - browser cache
- 404 for favicon - browser cache  
- 401 Unauthorized - cached JavaScript calling API before auth check

### After Clearing Cache:
These errors will disappear because the new code prevents API calls until authenticated.

## Application Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
