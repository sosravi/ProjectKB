# Testing Instructions with Your Credentials

## Your Credentials:
- Email: thravi@gmail.com
- Password: FWn*!v7$qsvg

## Testing Steps:

1. **Go to the site**: http://projectkb-production-builds-aa11c8fa.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

2. **You'll automatically be redirected to /login**

3. **You may see console errors BEFORE logging in** - these are expected because:
   - You're not authenticated yet
   - The API correctly returns 401 (Unauthorized)
   - This means security is working!

4. **Log in with your credentials**

5. **After logging in:**
   - You should be redirected to the dashboard
   - Console errors should stop (or only show once during initial load)
   - You should see your PKBs (or empty state if none created yet)

## Expected Behavior:

✅ BEFORE login: Console may show 401 errors (normal)
✅ AFTER login: Should work perfectly
✅ Dashboard: Should load your PKBs
✅ No functional issues: App works despite console warnings

## The Real Test:

Try logging in and let me know:
1. Can you log in successfully?
2. Do you get redirected to dashboard?
3. Does the dashboard load?

If YES to all three, then the app is working and console errors are cosmetic.
