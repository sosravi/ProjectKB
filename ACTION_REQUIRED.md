# Action Required - Test Now!

## What I Fixed:
The Lambda function was looking for authentication in the wrong place. I updated it to read the JWT token from the Authorization header.

## Next Steps:
1. **Refresh your dashboard page** (the one you're logged into)
2. Click the "Retry" button on the error message
3. Or navigate away and back to the dashboard

You should now see your PKBs load (or an empty state if you haven't created any yet).

## Expected Result:
- ✅ No more "Unauthorized" error
- ✅ Dashboard loads successfully
- ✅ Empty state or list of PKBs

Try it now!
